**Goal:** Provide ready-to-use ad copy and visual direction for all Meta/Instagram ad creatives.

## Brand Voice Guide

**Tone:** Confident, contrarian, slightly provocative. Not salesy (ironic, given the product). Think: a smart friend giving you advice over coffee, not a guru on a webinar.

**Key phrases to use:**
- "Stop selling. Start letting people buy."
- "The reluctant approach"
- "Close more by pushing less"
- "There's a canyon of difference"

**Language to avoid:**
- "Guaranteed results" / "Get rich quick"
- "Limited time only" / fake urgency
- "Secret" / "hack" / "trick"
- Anything that sounds like a typical internet marketing pitch (that's the opposite of our brand)

**Color palette:**
- Primary: Rich gold (#B8963E)
- Secondary: Deep green (#3A7D44)
- Background: Clean white/light gray
- Text: Near-black (#1C1C1E)
- Accent: Blue (#007AFF)

## A/B Testing Plan

For each ad set, test 2-3 variations:

| Variable to Test | Option A | Option B |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Headline | "Stop Selling" | "Close More by Pushing Less" |
| CTA | "Learn More" | "Shop Now" |
| Price emphasis | Lead with "Free simulator" | Lead with "$88 one-time" |
| Visual style | Light background | Dark background |
| Primary text length | Short (2-3 sentences) | Long (full story) |

**Rule:** Only test ONE variable at a time. Otherwise you won't know what made the difference.
